					{ answer: 'Coordinator' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'A project manager has very little project experience, but he has been assigned as the project manager of a new project. Because he will be working in a matrix organization to complete his project, he can expect communications to be:',
				explanation: 'Because a project done in a matrix organization involves people from across the organization, communications are more complex. ',

Though his first project is small. this one seems to be growing in size every day. As each day passes, the project manager is beginning to feel more and more in need of help. The project manager has recently heard that there was another project in the company last year that is similar to his second project. What should he do?',
				explanation: 'There are many things the project manager could do. Asking the other project manager for assistance is not the best choice, as the other project manager might not be an experienced mentor. His advice might not be adequate to help this project manager. Waiting to assess the impact on the project is reactive; a project manager should be proactive. Gaining agreement of all the stakeholders on the project scope is also not the best choice. It would be helpful, but does not specifically address the issue in this situation. By contacting the PMO, the project manager can access the knowledge of many project managers, historical information from many projects, and the assistance of someone whose job it is to help. ',

				]
			},
			{	question: 'To obtain support for the project throughout the performing organization, it`s BEST if the project manager:',
				explanation: 'Connecting the project to the sponsor`s objectives might be a good idea, but it does not address the issue of obtaining support throughout the performing organization. Neither a communications management plan nor an overall management plan directly addresses obtaining support for the project. Correlating the need for the project to the organization`s strategic plan is the best way to gain support for the project. ',
				answers: [

			{	question: 'Your management has decided that all orders will be treated as "projects" and that project managers will be used to update orders daily, to resolve issues, and to ensure the customer formally accepts the product within 30 days of completion. Revenue from the individual orders can vary from US $100 to US $150,000. The project manager will not be required to perform planning or provide documentation other than daily status. How would you define this situation?',
				explanation: 'Because orders are numerous and of short duration, this situation is a recurring process, not a project. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Because each individual order is a "temporary endeavor" each order is a project.' },
					{ answer: 'This is program management since there are multiple projects involved.' },
					{ answer: 'This is a recurring process.', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Orders incurring revenue over $100,000 would be considered projects and would involve project management.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'The previous project manager for your project managed it without much project organization. There is a lack of management control and no clearly defined project deliverables. Which of the following would be the BEST choice for getting your project better organized?',
				explanation: 'Developing lessons learned would help improve subsequent phases, but would do nothing for control or deliverables. Having plans for each work package would help control each phase, but would not control the integration of those phases into a cohesive whole. A description of the product of the project would help, but that would not improve both control and deliverables for each phase. Effective project management requires a life cycle approach to running the project. Adopting a I ife cycle approach is the only answer that covers both control and deliverables. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Adopt a life cycle approach to the project.', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Develop lessons learned for each phase.' },
					{ answer: 'Develop specific work plans for each work package.' },
					{ answer: 'Develop a description of the product of the project.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'A project team is working on manufacturi ng a new product, but they are having difficulty creating a project charter. What is the BEST description of the real problem?',
				explanation: 'Manufacturing a product is an ongoing process; it is operational work, not project work. Therefore, the manufacturing team would have no reason to create a project charter and would have difficulty doing so if they tried, because of the ongoing nature of the work. If the question referred to a team developing a new product, however, that would qualify as a project. ',

				]
			},
			{	question: 'One of your team members informs you that he does not know which of the many projects he is working on is the most important. Who should determine the priorities between projects in a company?',
				explanation: 'Because the question talks about priorities between projects, this cannot be the role of the project manager, the project management team, or the project team. Determining priorities between projects is a role of the PMO. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'TIle project manager' },
					{ answer: 'The project management team' },
					{ answer: 'The project management office (PMO)', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'The team' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'The difference between a project, program, and portfolio is:',
				explanation: 'A project is a temporary endeavor with a beginning and an end, a program is a group of related projects, and a portfolio is a group of projects and programs related to a specific strategic objective. Remember to use the process of elimination, ruling out any answer that is not completely correct. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'A project is a temporary endeavor with a beginning and an end, a program may include other nonproject work, and a portfolio is all the projects in a given department or division.' },
					{ answer: 'A project is a lengthy endeavor with a beginning and an end, a program combines two or more unrelated projects, and a portfolio combines two or more programs.' },

					{ answer: 'A part of every project activity.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'Company procedures require the creation of a lessons learned document. Which of the following is the BEST use oflessons learned?',
				explanation: 'Notice that this question asks about the use of a tool of project management. Many people can learn from a book what a lessons learned document is, but questions like this can more readily be answered if you actually use the tool and know from experience its value. Ask yourself about the other tools of project management. Why are they beneficial? The BEST use of lessons learned is as historical records for future projects. There are other tools that are better for accomplishing the things listed in the other choices. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Historical records for future projects', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Planning record for the current project' },

					{ answer: 'Informing the team about the project management plan' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'Lessons learned are BEST completed by:',
				explanation: 'The best answer is stakeholders, as their input is critical for collecting all the lessons learned on each project. The term "stakeholders" includes all the other groups. ',
				answers: [

					{ answer: 'The team.' },
					{ answer: 'The sponsor.' },
					{ answer: 'The stakeholders.', correct: true },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'Consideration of ongoing operations and maintenance is crucially important to products of projects. Ongoing operations and maintenance should:',
				explanation: 'Remember the definition of a project: temporary and unique. Operations and maintenance are considered ongoing activities, not temporary. Therefore, such work is not considered a project or part of a project. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Be included as activities to be performed during project closure.' },
					{ answer: 'Have a separate phase in the project life cycle, because a large portion of life cycle costs is devoted to maintenance and operations.' },

				]
			},
			{	question: 'What is a program?',
				explanation: 'Did you select "a group of unrelated projects managed in a coordinated way"? If so, you missed the word "unrelated." Programs are groups of related projects. ',

				]
			},
			{	question: 'The project team has just completed the initial project schedule and budget. Hie NEXT thing to do is to:',
				explanation: 'Communications requirements and quality standards are needed before risks (especially risks relating to communications and quality) can be determined. Iterations cannot begin until the risks are identified, qualified and quantified, and responses are developed.',

					{ answer: 'Functional manager.' },
					{ answer: 'Sponsor.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'Which of the following is NOT an input to the initiating process group?',
				explanation: 'Notice the question asks which is NOT an input to project initiating. Did you read it correctly? Companies should have processes in place for hiring resources, reporting, and managing risks on projects (to name only a few). These are inputs to project initiating, as are company culture and historical WBSs. The project scope statement is an output of project planning.',

					{ answer: 'Project scope statement', correct: true },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'The project sponsor has just signed the project charter. What is the NEXT thing to do?',
				explanation: 'To answer this type of question, look for the choice that occurs closest to the process group you are in. The project charter is created during project initiating. Completing work packages is done during project executing. Validating scope and performing integrated change control are done during project monitoring and controlling. Starting to create management plans is the best choice, as it is part of project planning.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Begin to complete work packages.' },

			{	question: 'The WBS and WBS dictionary are completed. The project team has begun working on identifying risks. The sponsor contacts the project manager, requesting that the responsibility assignment matrix be issued. The project has a budget of US $100,000 and is taking place in three countries using 14 human resources. There is little risk expected for the project, and the project manager has managed many projects similar to this one. What is the NEXT thing to do?',
				explanation: 'Look at the order of planning the project that the team has chosen. Although understanding the experience of the sponsor might sound like a good idea, the sponsor is a stakeholder and understanding the stakeholders is part of stakeholder analysis. That should have occurred before the creation of a WBS. Project scope must be defined before a WBS can be created. Completing risk management and issuing the responsibility assignment matrix cannot be best, as that work does not come next in the process. Other work must be done before risk management can effectively be completed. Creating an activity list comes next after the WBS and WBS dictionary.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Understand the experience of the sponsor on similar projects.' },

			},
			{	question: 'A project manager does not have much time to spend on planning before the mandatory start date arrives. He therefore wants to move through planning as effectively as possible. What advice would you offer?',
				explanation: 'This question is asking which of the choices is the most effective way to move through project planning. Starting the WBS immediately after obtaining a project charter skips the important steps of defining the scope and other activities. High-level assumptions are determined in project initiating. Quality metrics are determined as part of the quality management plan, not after it. The aclivily list is created before the network diagram, so that is the best option.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Make sure you have a signed project charter and then start the WBS.' },
					{ answer: 'Create an activity list before creating a network diagram.', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Document all the known risks before you document the high-level assumptions.' },

			{	question: 'A project manager gets a call from a team member notifying him that there is a variance between the speed of a system on the project and the desired or planned speed. The project manager is surprised because that performance measurement was not identified in planning. If the project manager then evaluates whether the variance warrants a response, he is in which part of the project management process?',
				explanation: 'Even though the measurement was not identified in planning, the project manager would still have to investigate the variance and determine if it is important. The project manager is in project monitoring and controlling.',

			{	question: 'During a team meeting, a team member asks about the measurements that will be used on the project to assess performance. The team member feels that some of the measures related to activities assigned to him are not valid measurements. The project is BEST considered to be in what part of the project management process?',
				explanation: 'This situation does not describe an actual measurement (a monitoring and controlling activity) but rather a meeting occurring during project executing.',

			{	question: 'Which of the following is the MOST appropriate thing to do during the initiating process group?',
				explanation: 'A detailed description of the project deliverables is created during project planning, as part of creating the project scope statement. Root cause analysis occurs during project monitoring and controlling, not initiating. Ensuring all project management processes are complete occurs during project closing.
